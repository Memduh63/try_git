// Lists, Sets, and Maps
// Letâ€™s start with the List type, an immutable singly linked list. You can create a list by
// invoking it as a function, passing in its contents in the form of comma-separated parameters:

val numbers = List(32, 95, 24, 21, 17)
val colors = List("red", "green", "blue")
println(s"I have ${colors.size} colors: $colors")
colors.head
colors.tail
