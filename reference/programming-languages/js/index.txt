The contents in this file is used to guide you to know what's in here. NOTE: a combination of javascript and jQuery tips are documented.

fbshare.js: contains functions to aid in implementing a Facebook Share button. Notice a jQuery onReady event at end of file.
html/fbshare.html: an example of usage for fbshare.js
windowload.js: A snippet to remind me about the fact when to execute something in jquery when all page has been loaded.
               Difference: $(document).ready() is an event that fires when DOM is ready (not necessarily all scripts have executed and images have 
			   loaded).
			   $(window).load is an event that fires only when all images have loaded and scripts have been run.
