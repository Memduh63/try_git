    <p>We often forget how miraculous glasses are until we see a baby with poor vision trying them on for the first time. Proud mother Jessica Sinclair recently posted a heartwarming video on her Facebook page of her 11-month-old daughter Piper trying on glasses for the first time. The baby girl is apparently extremely far-sighted, so this occasion marked the first time she ever saw her parents — or anything else — clearly. As you can imagine, she was positively thrilled with the development.

Her reaction melts my heart,” Sinclair writes on Facebook. The video has predictably gone viral and has been shared on Facebook over 350,000 times as of this writing. You’ll see why when you watch the whole thing yourself below.

    <p>I can see the future. I can see all the way to 2018. A bold new iPhone 8 will make its debut in September, and it will look like nothing we’ve ever seen before from Apple. It will also look nothing like this. DON’T MISS: Apple’s iPhone 6s is almost here… time to take out the trash Graphic designer Jermaine Smit has made some pretty cool stuff in the past. His new iPhone 8 concept probably isn’t among his finest works, though. Smit published a video to YouTube earlier this month that’s now making the rounds on a few gadget blogs, and there are some pretty cool elements to be found in his vision. A 2K (or better) display is a pretty safe bet, and it would be nice to see a design with a bezel on the sides of the screen that are as narrow as the ones pictured here. Wireless charging would also be cool, as would some nifty virtual reality features. If you think the iPhone 8 is going to look like a flattened iPhone 5 though, you’ve got another thing coming. iphone-8-nope Apple has been moving away from the iPhone 5’s design identity and has been unifying the look of its iPhone and iPad lines. The company has also been busy figuring out how to hide the antenna lines on its phones. The odds of Apple turning back the clock, moving away from a rounded aluminum design, and going back to the iPhone 5’s external antenna setup are just about nil. The designer’s full video is embedded below.

        Home Topics Deals Reviews Podcast Apple iPhone 6 Free Apps Tip Us Why the Apple Watch is no flop, and why Apple isn’t even breaking a sweat over early sales By Yoni Heisler on Jul 14, 2015 at 1:41 PM Opinions Share This Story Tweet Like Share Share Submit Apple Watch Sales Earlier this week, the research firm Slice Intelligence disclosed that cumulative Apple Watch sales likely fall somewhere in the 3 million unit range. Moreover, Slice Intelligence just one week earlier revealed that Apple Watch sales have dropped by an astounding 90% since the device first went on sale back in April. In turn, we’ve seen the usual carousel of critics come out and boldly declare that the Apple Watch is a flop. While such stories certainly make for intriguing headlines, there simply isn’t enough evidence to support such a theory this early on in the game. Here’s the thing: even if we assume that Slice Intelligence’s methodology and sales figures are accurate, the idea that 3 million in Apple Watch sales in just 3 months time constitutes a flop is laughable. Here’s why. DON’T MISS: Apple’s iPhone 6s is almost here… time to take out the trash Rightly or wrongly, everything Apple has released since 2007 is immediately compared to the iPhone. That said, let’s be frank: the Apple Watch is not nearly as revolutionary a device as the iPhone was. It’s not even close. So why, pray tell, are we still preoccupied with examining the success of the Apple Watch through the prism of a completely different device? While such comparisons are simple and easy to digest, they’re far from instructive. Before the “Apple Watch is a flop” bandwagon falls off the rails, perhaps we should go back in time, back before the iPhone was even a glimmer of a thought in Steve Jobs’ head, and look at the iPod. Though it’s been a while since the iPod was at all relevant, recall that Apple’s music player, at its peak, was an absolute juggernaut. In addition to attaining both critical and mainstream acclaim, it simultaneously padded Apple’s bank account with billions. No matter what lens you examine the iPod through, it’s impossible to deny that the device was a game changing product through and through. Yet if we go back to October of 2001, back when the original iPod was released, sales were far from explosive. In fact, initial iPod sales were far lower than initial estimates of Apple Watch sales. Here’s the cold hard data: By the end of 2002, after the iPod had been on the market for 15 months, cumulative iPod sales checked in at just 600,000 units. Believe it or not, it took Apple nearly two years before they even sold their one millionth iPod. By the end of 2003, about 27 months! after its initial introduction, Apple finally sold its two millionth iPod. Truth be told, iPod sales never really began to skyrocket until 2004, a good few years after its initial introduction. ipod annual sales And yet, critics and pundits, so quick to forget the past, are curiously quick on the trigger to declare the Apple Watch a flop without even giving the product line time to mature. Before we get all pessimistic about the Apple Watch, let’s consider a few things: The device requires an iPhone 5 or above in order to work at all. The Apple Watch is only available in Apple retail stores. It’s no secret that the Apple Watch at launch was subject to limited supply as Apple initially struggled to work out some of early manufacturing kinks. The Apple Watch is a $350+ accessory. Taking all of that into account, are we really supposed to believe that 3 million unit sales is something to scoff at? By way of contrast, it took Pebble about two years to sell one million units of their own wearable. Apple managed to trump that figure in just three months. In what world are we living in that people expect sales of an expensive accessory to match up with the once-in-a-lifetime product that was the iPhone? In what world does selling 3 million units of a high-margin device, in a product category that was previously non-existent in a mainstream sense, constitute a failure? Sure, the Apple Watch may not be a runaway hit, but it’s far too early in the game to declare it a disappointing flop. The Apple Watch needs time to mature. There needs to be more time for consumers to realistically consider the device as a viable purchase. Perhaps, the sales trajectory of the Apple Watch will one day soon mimic the sales trajectory of the iPod. Or perhaps not. All we can say with absolute certainty is that making a final call on the Apple Watch is pretty absurd, especially given Apple’s penchant for significantly increasing the value proposition of its devices with each passing generation. At the end of the day, it’s important to remember that the Apple Watch is an expensive accessory. Moreover, it’s a watch, a device that was practically made extinct by the smartphone revolution. And through it all, Apple still managed to sell 3 million units. If forced to choose, that sounds more like a promising success than a failure.
